#Know Your Planet!

###Game Info:
Two player game, first to five points wins at which point the game also resets. A series of photos rotates through the screen and Player One and Two have to correctly identify the location of each photo from four possible options. Each correct answer garners one point.

###Teachnologies Utilized:
*HTML5
*CSS3
*Javascript
*jQuery
*Bootstrap 3
*SweetAlert
*Google Fonts

###References:
All photos used in the slide show were gathered from Google Earth, however the landing image used was gathered from nasa.gov.

###Moving Forward:
There are just under 100 photos that rotate through the game, which means that the same image rarely appears twice in a row, but it can. I'd like to correct that moving forward. I'd also like to make it more mobile friendly than it currently is. It can be viewed on a mobile device, but cannot be considered optimized for mobile use. I'd also like to implement a countdown timer for each player's turn so that choices are made relativley quickly.
